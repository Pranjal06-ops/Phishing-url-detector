## 🌍 Overview

Phishing attacks are one of the most common cybersecurity threats, often delivered through malicious links that appear legitimate.  
This project provides an **ML-based phishing URL detection system** that predicts whether a URL is safe or harmful — in real time.

The system is:
- **Accurate** — trained on real-world phishing & benign datasets  
- **Fast** — lightweight inference suitable for real-time use  
- **Deployable** — run locally, via REST API, web UI, or Docker
